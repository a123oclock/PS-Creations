The main thing we were striving for in this project was perfection or as close as we could get. It was very important for the components of our spaceships to fit together seamlessly and for it to have a perfectly smooth surface and finish. We were initially given silicone moulds to create the main form of the spaceship, this was where we used the car-body filler. The moulds were purposely imperfect so it gave us something to work on and practice our technique. 

Other materials I used included acrylic for the bottom panel of the spaceship, styrene for the centre piece and plastic rods for the legs. The acrylic piece was sanded at both ends to the curvature of the spaceship body and polished with T-cut to finish, this was then masked with tape and back-sprayed so the colour would show through the acrylic.  All the other components were sprayed with plastic primer and then coated with a spray paint of my 
choice. I decided on a full coverage base colour, a speckled effect on top and a gloss to finish.
